# Shakespearean License
## Introduction
A simple but not so legible perhaps free/open-source software license similar to MIT/BSD type of licenses but with better legalese such that it won't be as easy to read but it will make more sense to a judge should some "enterprising" attorney decide to try driving a truck through some potential loopholes as has been tried before eg. the UW Pine case, where not only there was an attempt to abuse copyright legalese but also trademarks; patent vs. copyright abuses are in the spotlight but few people think about trademarks and in my non-professional opinion (I'm not a lawyer I just play one on TV) a lot of typical non-endorsement clauses could be abused in regards to trademarks, which are required to be actively defended or you lose them unlike copyrights...

This license is also expressly intended to avoid any mention of patents, which are an entirely separate subject of intellectual property law, except to say that they are completely irrelevant to the unconditional grant of rights under this license. This GPL/Apache copyright termination subject to non-exercise of patent rights is completely insane and just sour grapes from people who believe software patents should not exist and prefer to pretend that they don't, but, like them or not, they do; this is not RMS Fantasyland. If you don't like someone's patent, don't use it, I'm not going to be the one to attempt to tell them what they can or can't do with it and that they can't use MY software at the same time as exercising their patent rights.

Also intends for more precise use of terminology as defined in the US Code (I live here that's all I know about) and international copyright treaties, especially important in this day and age where the letter of the law is "surely" more important than its spirit...

## Origin of Name and Objective
I figured the "Let's Kill All the Lawyers" License wouldn't end up going over too well with said judge...But it occurred to me that the goal of this license is basically treat your code (or whatever) like Shakespeare; we know Shakespeare wrote and made a living off his plays, you can't blatantly copypasta rip him off without everyone knowing that it was Shakespare, but now he's long dead and gone and the fact that he wrote it surely doesn't entitle his current living descendants to further royalties as Disney would still be in 500 years for copies of Steamboat Willie if they had their way, it's in the public domain as it should be and you can do what you want with it other than claim ownership of it and/or register a copyright for it.

The problem with "releasing things into the public domain" rather than adding a copyright notice+registration accompanied by a license to all rights in perpetuity is that you CAN'T; the public domain is defined by the law and one does not simply add things to the public domain by declaration without an accompanying Act of Congress.

In fact if you do that, anyone in the world can rip it off and claim it as their own work and even be granted a copyright registration for it, see the Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin whitepaper, and then it's up to a judge whether you do or do not own the copyright to your work and therefore whether you did or did not have the legal authority to grant anyone else any rights in the first place, and that can't possibly be good for you or for anyone. Except of course lawyers and conmen who may or may not also be lawyers. Not all conmen are lawyers; not all lawyers are conmen; but the worst lawyers and the worst conmen are often both.

## Applications
Mainly targeted at software since that's about all the copyrightable works I am personally responsible for, but the goal is for it to be general enough so that it can be used to license any copyrightable work in a similar manner like Creative Commons but without all the various intricate complications introduced by Creative Commons licensing; plus the whole point here is to  grant all possible rights to anyone with no restrictions except attribution so Creative Commons Attribution is the only comparable license for e.g. books and audiovisual recordings, and the CC0 license is not only legally invalid in the United States again in my entirely un-professional opinion for the reasons mentioned in the previous section, but it is also actively harmful to the interests of anyone attempting to license their works under it.
